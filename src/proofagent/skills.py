"""Skill proofs — evaluate and score an agent's competence at real tasks.

While safety packs prove an agent refuses harmful requests, skill proofs
prove an agent is *competent*. Each skill pack contains challenge prompts
with rubrics that an LLM judge scores against.

Usage:
    proofagent skill claude-sonnet-4-6 --skill coding
    proofagent skill claude-sonnet-4-6 --skill all
    proofagent skill run claude-sonnet-4-6 --pack ./my_skills.yaml
